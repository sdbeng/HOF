# Presentation Prompt

## Goal
** Student can demonstrate the proper use of a callback function by passing a function to another function as a parameter **

## intro to students - IWY
1- Hey everyone! How is everyone doing? I'm happy to see you all here.

2- Today, we're going to start with a brief review of what are variables, write some code, and run it in the browser console. Then we continue with functions, to finally learn the concept of High Order Functions or HOF.

Open a new CodePen to begin coding.

### Variables
- A variable is a named item that points to a piece of data.
- In JS variables do not need to be typed.
- We have access to that variable within the scope it was created. We can pass a variable around and use it whenever we want to.

Let's see that in codePen.

### Functions
- A function is a block of code that is encapsulated and can be run at any time.
- A function can be assigned to a variable.
- A function can take dynamic data. When the function is initialized this data is named, but not yet assigned. This is called a parameter.
- When we call a function, we can pass data into it. This is called an argument.
- Parameters and arguments can be any data type.
- We can pass data directly as an argument, or we can pass a variable.
- A parameter/argument can be ANY valid Javascript data type. (string, boolean, number, array, object, etc. hint: don't say function, yet)

### HOF: High Order Functions
